BearchInc/code-challenge Mars Rover Problem solution

  Hello! This is my solution to the aforementioned problem. 
  This was a really fun experience!

The main class of the project is MarsRoverController, so the solution can be tested by using the command "java MarsRoverController" inside out folder where the classes are located. Alternatively, one can edit the JUnit tests (in special those in MarsRoverControllerTest file).

Everything should be documented and explained in the project itself. The aspect most worthy of note would be the aproach of having an enumerator with unit vectors as values to represent the orientations and use the vectors to simplify movement logic. Exceptions were added as needed to make the code more modular.

Thank you for your time.
